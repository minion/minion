How to use Minion
=================

Firstly, before you start writing Minion input -- we suggest you don't!

Minion's input language is (purposefully) low-level, think of it like "computer code". Most users should use higher-level languages, such as Essence' using the `SavileRow <https://www-users.york.ac.uk/peter.nightingale/savilerow/>`_ constraint system, or Essence using the `Conjure <https://www.github.com/conjure-cp/conjure>` system. These will produce input for Minion, and also handle parsing the solutions given from Minion back to a nice, easy-to-read format.

If you still want to dive into how Minion represents variables, constraints, and search, then read on!
