The following directory is full of Minion tests. To add a new test, do the
following:

1) Put the file in here, with the extension .minion

2) Make sure that the "print" command prints a matrix, which contains
   on a single line (it can be empty)
   
3) Put one of the following as the very first line, after "MINION x"

   #TEST CHECKONESOL x x x ...
     The first solution found will be x x x ... (as given by the "print" 
     statement).
   #TEST SOLCOUNT x
     There will be x solutions found in the whole search (can be 0)
   #TEST EXITCODE1
     Minion will fail with the exit code 1. This is useful to ensure that Minion
     fails due to a deliberate exception, not by segfault.

There are two other important poss options #FAIL and #BUG, which act the same,
but have different intentions.
   #BUG
	 This test currently fails due to a bug in Minion.
	
   #FAIL
     This test is supposed to fail (for example, checking parsing rejects
     incorrect input).
