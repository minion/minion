<h1>Help on <tt>variables vectors</tt></h1>
<h3>Description</h3>
<pre>
Vectors, matrices and tensors can be declared in minion
input. Matrices and tensors are for convenience, as constraints do not
take these as input; they must first undergo a flattening process to
convert them to a vector before use.
</pre>
<h3>Examples</h3>
<pre>
A vector of 0/1 variables:

BOOL myvec[5]

A matrix of discrete variables:

DISCRETE sudoku[9,9] {1..9}

A 3D tensor of 0/1s:

BOOL mycube[3,3,2]

One can create a vector from scalars and elements of vectors, etc.:

alldiff([x,y,myvec[1],mymatrix[3,4]])

When a matrix or tensor is constrained, it is treated as a vector
whose entries have been strung out into a vector in index order with
the rightmost index changing most quickly, e.g.

alldiff(sudoku)

is equivalent to

alldiff([sudoku[0,0],...,sudoku[0,8],...,sudoku[8,0],...,sudoku[8,8]])

Furthermore, with indices filled selectively and the remainder filled
with underscores (_) the flattening applies only to the underscore
indices:

alldiff(sudoku[4,_])

is equivalent to

alldiff([sudoku[4,0],...,sudoku[4,8]])

Lastly, one can optionally add square brackets ([]) around an
expression to be flattened to make it look more like a vector:

alldiff([sudoku[4,_]])

is equivalent to

alldiff(sudoku[4,_])
