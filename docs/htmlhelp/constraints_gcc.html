<h3>Description</h3>
<pre>
The Generalized Cardinality Constraint (GCC) constrains the number of each value
that a set of variables can take.

gcc([primary variables], [values of interest], [capacity variables])

For each value of interest, there must be a capacity variable, which specifies
the number of occurrences of the value in the primary variables.

This constraint is new, and its syntax and implementation are not finalised.
</pre>
<h3>Example</h3>
<pre>
Suppose the input file had the following vectors of variables defined:

DISCRETE myVec[9] {1..9}
BOUND cap[9] {0..2}

The following constraint would restrict the occurrence of values 1..9 in myVec
to be at most 2 each initially, and finally equal to the values of the cap
vector.

gcc(myVec, [1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9], cap)
</pre>
<h3>Notes</h3>
<pre>
This constraint enforces a hybrid consistency. It reads the bounds of the
capacity variables, then enforces GAC over the primary variables only.  Then the
bounds of the capacity variables are updated using flow algorithms similar to
those proposed by Quimper et al, Improved Algorithms for the Global Cardinality
Constraint.

This constraint provides stronger propagation to the capacity variables than the
gccweak constraint.
