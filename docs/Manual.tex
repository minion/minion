\chapter{Introduction to Minion}

Minion is a solver for constraint satisfaction problems. First we
introduce constraints, then give a general overview of Minion. Following
this we give instructions for installation and basic use.


\section{What are constraints?}

Constraints are a powerful and natural means of knowledge representation
and inference in many areas of industry and academia. Consider, for
example, the production of a university timetable. This problem's
constraints include: the maths lecture theatre has a capacity of 100
students; art history lectures require a venue with a slide projector;
no student can attend two lectures simultaneously. Constraint solving
of a combinatorial problem proceeds in two phases. First, the problem
is \emph{modelled} as a set of \emph{decision variables}, and a set
of \emph{constraints} on those variables that a solution must satisfy.
A decision variable represents a choice that must be made in order
to solve the problem. The \emph{domain} of potential values associated
with each decision variable corresponds to the options for that choice.
In our example one might have two decision variables per lecture,
representing the time and the venue. For each class of students, the
time variables of the lectures they attend may have an AllDifferent
constraint on them to ensure that the class is not timetabled to be
in two places at once. The second phase consists of using a constraint
solver to search for \emph{solutions}: assignments of values to decision
variables satisfying all constraints. The simplicity and generality
of this approach is fundamental to the successful application of constraint
solving to a wide variety of disciplines such as scheduling, industrial
design and combinatorial mathematics \cite{wallace:Survey}.

To illustrate, figure \ref{fig:Alphametic-problem} shows a simple
puzzle, where two six-digit numbers (DONALD and GERALD) are added
together to form another six-digit number (ROBERT). Each letter A,
B, D, E, G, L, N, O, R and T represents a distinct digit $0\ldots9$.
The puzzle can be represented with the expressions below, given by
Bessi\`ere and R\'egin \cite{bessiere-gac-schema}.

\begin{eqnarray*}
100000\times\textrm{D}+10000\times\textrm{O}+1000\times\textrm{N}+100\times\textrm{A}+10\times\textrm{L}+\textrm{D}\\
+100000\times\textrm{G}+10000\times\textrm{E}+1000\times\textrm{R}+100\times\textrm{A}+10\times\textrm{L}+\textrm{D}\\
=100000\times\textrm{R}+10000\times\textrm{O}+1000\times\textrm{B}+100\times\textrm{E}+10\times\textrm{R}+\textrm{T}\\
\textrm{and allDifferent}(\textrm{A, B, D, E, G, L, N, O, R, T})\end{eqnarray*}


This representation of the puzzle illustrates the main concepts of
constraint programming. A, B, D, E, G, L, N, O, R and T are variables,
each with initial domain $0\ldots9$. There are two constraints, one
representing the sum and the other representing that the variables
each take a different value. A solution is a function mapping each
variable to a value in its initial domain, such that all constraints
are satisfied. The solution to this puzzle is A=4, B=3, D=5, E=9,
G=1, L=8, N=6, O=2, R=7, T=0.

\end{figure}


Constraints are \emph{declarative} --- the statement of the problem
and the algorithms used to solve it are separated. This is an attractive
feature of constraints, since it can reduce the human effort required
to solve a problem. Various general purpose and specialized algorithms
exist for solving systems of constraints. A great variety of problems
can be expressed with constraints. The following list of subject areas
was taken from CSPLib \cite{csplib}:

\begin{itemize}
\item Scheduling (e.g. job shop scheduling \cite{martin-jobshop-96new}),
\item Design, configuration and diagnosis (e.g. template design \cite{proll-smith-templatedesign}),
\item Bin packing and partitioning (e.g. social golfer problem \cite{harvey01symmetry}),
\item Frequency assignment (e.g. the golomb ruler problem \cite{smith99golomb}),
\item Combinatorial mathematics (e.g. balanced incomplete block design \cite{frisch-symmetry-implied-04}),
\item Games and puzzles (e.g. maximum density still life \cite{smith-model-life}), 
\item Bioinformatics (e.g. discovering protein shapes \cite{protein-structure-problems}).
\end{itemize}

\section{Solving constraint problems}

The classical constraint satisfaction problem (CSP) has a finite set
of variables, each with a finite domain, and a set of constraints
over those variables. A solution to an instance of CSP is an assignment
to each variable, such that all constraints are simultaneously \emph{satisfied}
--- that is, they are all true under the assignment. Solvers typically
find one or all solutions, or prove there are no solutions. The decision
problem (`does there exist a solution?') is NP-complete \cite{apt-constraint-programming},
therefore there is no known polynomial-time procedure to find a solution.

The most common technique (and the one used by Minion) is to interleave
splitting (also called branching) and propagation. Splitting is the
basic operation of search, and propagation simplifies the CSP instance.
Apt views the solution process as the repeated transformation of the
CSP until a solution state is reached \cite{apt-constraint-programming}.
In this view, both splitting and propagation are transformations,
where propagation simplifies the CSP by removing values which cannot
take part in any solution. A splitting operation transforms a CSP
instance into two or more simpler CSP instances, and by recursive
application of splitting any CSP can be solved. 

Since splitting is an exponential-time solution method, it is important
that splitting is minimized by effective propagation. Much effort
has gone into developing propagation algorithms which are fast and
effective in removing values. Most propagation algorithms are specialized
to particular types of constraint (e.g. a vector of variables take
distinct values in any solution, the AllDifferent constraint). They
typically run in polynomial time.

Figure \ref{fig:solver-overview} is a simple representation of how
many constraint solvers (including Minion) work. The search element
is typically depth-first chronological backtracking by default, although
a solver will often allow different search algorithms to be programmed.
When searching, a variable and value must be selected. This can be
done statically or with a dynamic heuristic. The simplify component
contains a queue of constraints which need to be propagated. When
a constraint is propagated, and removes values from the variable domains,
the domain events cause other constraints to be added to the queue.
Propagation of constraints on the queue is iterated until the queue
is empty.

\section{Minion}

Minion accepts a file describing an instance of CSP, and solves it
as described above. From the user's point of view, the most important
features are the set of constraints Minion can reason with, and the
types of variables which are supported. These are described later
in this document. This section deals with installing Minion and getting
started with it.


\subsection{Installing Minion}

The main Minion website is \url{http://minion.sourceforge.net/},
and this contains links to the download page. Currently, executables with and
without debug information are provided for Mac, Linux, Cygwin, and
Windows\footnote{The Windows binaries currently do not support compressed input
files.}.


\subsection{Installation instructions for Windows}

Download the Windows archive \texttt{minion-x.y.z-windows.tar.gz} and unpack,
you should find Minion executable \texttt{minion.exe}. The executable should
work from the Windows command shell \texttt{cmd.exe}. Minion requires the
Microsoft Visual C++ 2008 Redistributable Package\footnote{The Microsoft Visual C++
Redistributable Package can be downloaded from
\url{http://www.microsoft.com/downloads/details.aspx?FamilyID=a5c84275-3b97-4ab7-a40d-3802b2af5fc2&displaylang=en}.}
to work. Please note that the package for Visual C++ 2010 will \emph{not} work.

Alternatively, you can get the archive \texttt{minion-x.y.z-cygwin.tar.gz} which
also contains some additional required DLL files.


\subsection{Installation instructions for Mac}

Download the Mac archive \texttt{minion-x.y.z-mac.tar.gz} and unpack. The contents
include universal binary \texttt{minion} which should work on both Intel and PowerPC
Macs with Mac OS X 10.4.2 or later.


\subsection{Installation instructions for Linux-x86 or x64}

Download the Linux archive \texttt{minion-x.y.z-linux.tar.gz} and unpack. It contains
the binary \texttt{minion}. The executable is linked statically.

\bigskip

All versions come with a debug variant as well. The debug executables are
contained in the \texttt{minion-x.y.z-debug-<os>.tar.gz}.


\subsection{Compilation instructions}

If there is no executable which works on your computer, you can use
the source package (named \texttt{minion-x.y.z-source.tar.gz}).

Minion uses the CMake\footnote{\url{http://www.cmake.org}} build system to check
for the required and optional components. Without any additional flags, the
standard binary will be built. The earliest version of CMake the build was
tested with is 2.4.7.

Note that you need at least g++ version 3.4.2 to compile Minion. Furthermore
boost\footnote{\url{http://www.boost.org/}} is required to build Minion. Any
version between 1.33 and 1.42.0 inclusive should work. If you have installed
boost in a non-standard location or CMake does not find it for some other
reason, you can try setting the environment variable \verb+BOOST_ROOT+ to your
boost installation directory for CMake 2.6, or \verb+Boost_INCLUDE_DIR+ to the
location of the boost header files for CMake 2.4.

The g++ distributed with Cygwin does \emph{not} compile Minion correctly because
of differences in exception handling in Unix and Windows. You have to compile
your own version of g++ and use this to compile Minion.

To compile, create a new directory for the build, and issue the
following commands on Unix:

\begin{verbatim}
cmake <path/to/minion>
make minion
\end{verbatim}

where \verb+<path/to/minion>+ is the path to the Minion distribution (the
directory which contains \verb+CMakeLists.txt+). The Cygwin version of CMake
seems to have a bug; run it twice to get Minion to compile and link correctly.

On Windows, use CMake to generate Visual Studio project files. You can then open
the project file in Visual Studio and compile it. The build was tested with Visual
Studio 9 2008.

If you have at least 2GB of RAM and a dual-core processor, you may prefer to
use
\begin{verbatim}
make minion -j2
\end{verbatim}
instead. As a rule of thumb, you should have 1GB of RAM for every compile
process. To build minion-debug, run
\begin{verbatim}
cmake -DDEBUG=1 <path/to/minion>
\end{verbatim}
instead of
\begin{verbatim}
cmake <path/to/minion>
\end{verbatim}
CMake caches the configuration between runs. If you built the debug binary first
and then want to build the non-debug version, you have to explicitely disable
that option, i.e.\ run
\begin{verbatim}
cmake -DDEBUG=0 <path/to/minion>
\end{verbatim}

More details on compile-time options can be found in section~\ref{compiletime}.

\subsection{Trying out the executable}

On all platforms, Minion needs to be run from a command shell so that
the output can be seen. If you go to the Minion directory in a shell
and run the executable, it should output version information and a
help message. 


\subsection{The debug variant}

One would normally use the non-debug variant of minion, which runs
at full speed. However, if some unexpected behaviour is observed,
running the debug variant may be helpful. It contains a large number
of assertions and other checks, and may bring to light a problem with
the input or an internal bug.

The CMake constants you should set to \verb+1+ to get a binary suitable for
debugging are \verb+DEBUG+ and \verb+INFO+.


\subsection{Minion online help}

To see the root page of the help system, run Minion with \texttt{help}
as the only argument. The help system is hierarchical, with the following
top-level categories: constraints, input, switches and variables,
with contents as follows:

\begin{description}
\item [{\texttt{constraints}}] This category contains a description of
every constraint which is allowed in the input CSP.
\item [{\texttt{input}}] Information about the input file format.
\item [{\texttt{switches}}] Information about command-line switches.
\item [{\texttt{variables}}] A description of each type of CSP variable
supported in Minion.
\end{description}
To access the help for the alldiff constraint, for example, the command
would be \texttt{minion help constraints alldiff}. The full documentation
provided by the Minion executable is reproduced in the Appendix of 
this manual.


\subsection{Basic Minion use}

As a simple example of Minion input, we modelled the alphametic puzzle
in figure \ref{fig:Alphametic-problem}. The Minion input file shown
below consists of two sections: the variables, in which the 10 CSP
variables are declared along with their initial domains; and the constraints.
The allDifferent constraint in the example above is mapped into gacalldiff
here. The numerical constraint is translated into two constraints
as follows: $x+y=z$ is mapped to $x+y-z\le0$ and $x+y-z\ge0$ and
these two are represented using weightedsumleq and weightedsumgeq
respectively. The coefficients are specified first, with the coefficients
of ROBERT negated, followed by the list of variables.

\begin{verbatim}
MINION 3

**VARIABLES**

DISCRETE a {0..9}
DISCRETE b {0..9}
DISCRETE d {0..9}
DISCRETE e {0..9}
DISCRETE g {0..9}
DISCRETE l {0..9}
DISCRETE n {0..9}
DISCRETE o {0..9}
DISCRETE r {0..9}
DISCRETE t {0..9}

**CONSTRAINTS**

gacalldiff([a,b,d,e,g,l,n,o,r,t])

weightedsumleq([100000,10000,1000,100,10,1,
100000,10000,1000,100,10,1,
-100000,-10000,-1000,-100,-10,-1],
[d,o,n,a,l,d,g,e,r,a,l,d,r,o,b,e,r,t],0)

weightedsumgeq([100000,10000,1000,100,10,1,
100000,10000,1000,100,10,1,
-100000,-10000,-1000,-100,-10,-1],
[d,o,n,a,l,d,g,e,r,a,l,d,r,o,b,e,r,t],0)

**EOF**
\end{verbatim}

This example is in the Minion distribution, in directory benchmarks/small.
Executing \texttt{minion benchmarks/small/donaldgeraldrobert.minion}
gives the solution $A=4, B=3, D=5, E=9, G=1,
L=8, N=6, O=2, R=7, T=0.$

\chapter{Minion Internals}

This chapter explains several details about Minion's internals, which are useful to know when trying to get the most from Minion.

\section{Variable Types}

Minion's input language is purposefully designed to map exactly to Minion's internals. Unlike most other constraint solvers, Minion does not internally add extra variables and decompose large complex constraints into small parts. This provides complete control over how problems are implemented inside Minion, but also requires understanding how Minion works to get the best results.

For those who, quite reasonably, do not wish to get involved in such details, 'Tailor' abstracts away from these details, and also internally implements a number of optimisations.

One of the most immediately confusing features of Minion are the variable types. Rather than try to provide a "one-size-fits-all" variable implementation, Minion provides four different ones; \BOOL, \DISCRETE, \BOUND and \SPARSEBOUND.  First we shall provide a brief discussion of both what these variables are, and a brief discussion of how they are implemented currently.

\begin{description}
\item[\BOOL] Variables with domain \(\{0,1\}\). Uses special optimised data structure.
\item[\DISCRETE] Variables whose domain is a range of integers. Memory usage and the worst-case performance of most operations is O(domain size). Allows any subset of the domain to be represented.
\item[\BOUND] Variable whose domain is a range of integers. Memory usage and the worst-case performance of all operations is O(1). During search, the domain can only be reduced by changing one of the bounds.
\item[\SPARSEBOUND] Variable whose domain is an arbitary range of integers. Otherwise identical to BOUND.
\end{description}

It appears one obvious variable implementation, \texttt{SPARSEDISCRETE}, is missing. This did exist in some very early versions of Minion but due to bugs and lack of use was removed. 

Some of the differences between the variable types only effect performance, whereas some others can effect search size. We provide these here.

\begin{enumerate}
\item In any problem, changing a \BOOL variable to a \DISCRETE, \BOUND or \SPARSEBOUND variable with domain \(\{0,1\}\) should not change the size of the resulting search. \BOOL should always be fastest, followed by \DISCRETE, \BOUND and \SPARSEBOUND.

\item A \BOUND variable will in general produce a search with more nodes per second, but more nodes overall, than a \DISCRETE variable.

\item Using \SPARSEBOUND or \BOUND variables with a unary constraint imposing the sparse domain should produce identical searches, except the \SPARSEBOUND will be faster if the domain is sparse. 
\end{enumerate}

As a basic rule of thumb, Always use \BOOL for Boolean domains, \DISCRETE for domains of size up to around 100, and the \BOUND. With \DISCRETE domains, use the \texttt{w-inset} constraint to limit the domain. When to use \SPARSEBOUND over \BOUND is harder, but usually the choice is clear, as either the domain will be a range, or a set like \(\{1,10,100,100\}\).

\section{Choosing Between Minion's Constraints}

Minion has many constraints which at first glance appear to do almost identical things. These each have trade-offs, some of which are difficult to guess in advance. This section will provide some basic guidance.

One of the major design decisions of Minion's input language is that it provides in the input language exactly what it provides internally. Unlike most other constraint solvers, Minion does not break up constraints into smaller pieces, introduce new variables or simplify or manipulate constraints. This provides complete control over how Minion represents your problem, but also leads to a number of annoyances.

Probably the first thing you will notice it that Minion has neither a ``sum equals'' or ``weighted sum equals'' constraint. This is because the most efficiently we could implement such a constraint was simply by gluing together the sumleq and the sumgeq constraints. Minion could provide a wrapper which generated the two constraints internally, but this would go against the transparency. Of course if in the future a more efficient implementation of sumeq was found, it may be added.

The \texttt{watchsumgeq} and \texttt{watchsumleq} are varients on the algorithm used to implement SAT constraints. They are faster than \texttt{sumleq} and \texttt{sumgeq}, but only work when summing a list of Booleans to a constant. Further \texttt{watchsumgeq} performs best when the value being summed to is small, and \texttt{watchsumleq} works best when the value being summed to is close to the size of the input vector.

Minion does not attempt to simplify constraints, so constraints such as \texttt{sumgeq([a,a,a], 3)} are not simplified to \texttt{sumgeq([a],1)}. This kind of simplification, done by hand, will often improve models. Further, and importantly in practice, Minion pre-allocates memory based on the initial domain size of variables. If these are excessively slack, this can hurt performance throughout search.

Some constraints in Minion do not work on \texttt{BOUND} and \texttt{SPARSEBOUND} variables, in particular \texttt{gacalldiff} and \texttt{watchelement}. These two constraints are in general better when they can be used.

\section{Compile-time options}\label{compiletime}

There are a number of flags which can be given to Minion at compile time to
affect the resulting executable. These flags are prone to regular changes. By
searching the Minion source code, you may find others. These undocumented ones
are prone to breakage without warning.

The following flags are considered "blessed", and are fully tested (although in
future versions they may be removed or altered). Adding any of these flags
will probably slow the resulting Minion executable.

All of these flags have to be passed to \texttt{cmake} with the \verb+-D+
switch; for example
\begin{verbatim}
cmake -DNAME=MyMinion <path/to/minion>
\end{verbatim}
Again, keep in mind that \texttt{cmake} caches its configuration -- if you run
it again without specifying \verb+NAME+, it will assume the name you have given
before and \emph{not} the default.

\begin{description}
\item[\texttt{NAME=name}] Overrides Minion's default and names the executable
\verb+name+.
\item[\texttt{DEBUG=1}] Turns on a large number of internal consistency checks in
minion. This executable is much slower than normal minion, but vital when trying
to debug problems.
\item[\texttt{SLOW\_DEBUG=1}] Turns on even more internal checking; the resulting
executable will be much slower than standard Minion.
\item[\texttt{PRINT=1}] (Only meaningful with \texttt{DEBUG=1}) Turns on
more printing of information.
\item[\texttt{QUICK=1}] For optimisation reasons, Minion usually compiles many copies of
every constraint. This flag makes Minion compile each constraint only once. This
drastically reduces the time to compile and the size of the executable, but the
resulting executable is slower. This should never effect the results Minion
produces.
\item[\texttt{INFO=1}] Makes minion output a large, but poorly documented, set of
information about how search is progressing. This flag is useful for debugging
but should not be used for trying to following search (use the command line flag
-dumptree instead). This option is likely to be replaced with a more useful dump
of search in a future version of Minion.
\item[\texttt{UNOPTIMISED=1}] Turn off all compiler optimisation, so Minion can be
usefully checked in gdb.
\item[\texttt{PROFILE=1}] Set compiler optimisation flags that allow Minion to be
better profiled. Implies \texttt{UNOPTIMISED=1}.
\item[\texttt{GPROF=1}] (Only meaningful with \texttt{PROFILE=1}) Set compiler flags to profile the binary with
\texttt{gprof}.
\item[\texttt{REENTER=1}] Compile Minion so it is reenterent (more than one
problem can exist in memory at a time). At present reenterence is not used for
anything, and will only slightly slow Minion.
\item[\texttt{THREADSAFE=1}] Compile thread-safe Minion. Does not have any effect
right now.
\item[\texttt{SMALL=1}] Build a small binary by passing \verb+-Os+ to the
compiler.
\item[\texttt{WDEG=1}] Enable weighted degree variable heuristic. This may or may
not speed up Minion.
\item[\texttt{WTRIG=1}] Enable a weighted queue of triggers which will process the
cheapest trigger first. This only affects triggers of the same type. This may or
may not speed up Minion.
\item[\texttt{BACK\_VEC=1}] Keep backtrack memory in a vector instead of a
continuous block of memory.
\item[\texttt{CACHE\_MALLOC=1}] (Only meaningful with \texttt{BACK\_VEC=1}) Enable
caching malloc.
\item[\texttt{DISTCC=1}] Use \verb+distcc+ (if found). Experimental.
\end{description}

Furthermore the environment variable \verb+$CPU+ is taken into account when
running \texttt{cmake}. The contents of this variable are passed on to the
compiler without any processing; usually one would want to use it as a means of
specifying machine-specific compiler flags, such as producing code for a
specific CPU.

\subsection{Required and optional components}

Boost is required to build Minion (at least version 1.33). Bzip2 and Zlib are
optional, if they are not present, you will not be able to read compressed input
files. If a Common Lisp binary (\texttt{clisp}) is found, you will be able to
build the LISP generators. If you have a \texttt{doxygen} executable, you will
be able to generate the API documentation. If you have a \texttt{pdflatex}
executable and a UNIX-like system, you will be able to generate the PDF
documentation.

\subsection{Selective compilation of constraints}

The most time-consuming part of the Minion compilation process is the
compilation of all the constraints. If not all constraints are required, the
user may specify the constraints to be compiled into the binary in two ways.

When running \texttt{cmake} one can give it the \verb+-DCONSTRAINTS="<list>"+
flag to specify the semicolon-separated list of constraints to be compiled,
e.g.\
\begin{verbatim}
cmake -DCONSTRAINTS="sumleq;sumgeq" <path/to/minion>
\end{verbatim}

Alternatively, one can specify the name of a Minion input file or a file
containing a list of constraints with the \verb+-DCONSTRAINTS_FILE=<file>+
option, e.g.\
\begin{verbatim}
cmake -DCONSTRAINTS_FILE=input.minion <path/to/minion>
\end{verbatim}
Note that this does not work with compressed input files.

\chapter{Minion in Practice}
The previous chapter clearly outlined what the constructs of a Minon file are, including what the variable types are and which type of constraint should be used when. This chapter takes a more practical role, outlined within are 7 minion example files which are clearly commented so that the user can see what a minion file looks like in practice. Comments in minion start with a $\sharp$, however for reasons of ease of reading all lines of actual code be it Minion or Essence' are shown in typewriter text and comments are inserted in normal text. The first file is a modified version of the one that all the minion developers turn to when modelling a new problem in minion. It shows exactly what a minion file can include and what the syntax is for all the possible sections. If you are modelling a problem as minion than we recommend you take a copy of this file and edit it appropriately, as this will help to guide you through the modelling process. The rest of this chapter contains versions  of the minion input examples introduced in the Tailor chapter of this manual. These are all produced automatically by tailor from the Essence' specification given in that chapter. We hope the comments will clarify exactly what these files mean. These examples can be used as the bases to implement any similar problems. The Minion overview is completed in the last chapter where a full list of all the constraints is given, including a brief overview of how each operates. 

\section{Minion Example File}
This file does not really relate to any English problem description, although it does parse and run,  it is an example which clearly shows all of the possible Minion input file constructs. If you are modelling a problem as minion than we recommend you take a copy of this file and edit it appropriately, as this will help to guide you through the modelling process. It can be found in the \begin{verbatim}summer_school\end{verbatim} directory and is called \begin{verbatim}format_example.minion\end{verbatim} we have added comments  to explain the different sections to the novice user. 

\begin{verbatim}
MINION 3
\end{verbatim}

This file includes an example of all the different inputs  you can give to Minion.  It is a very good place to start from when modelling  problem in the Minion specification. 

 The first section is where all the variables are declared.
 \begin{verbatim}
**VARIABLES**
\end{verbatim}

There are 4 type of variables. Booleans don't need a domain and are formated as follows:
 \begin{verbatim}
BOOL bo    
 \end{verbatim}

Internally, Bound variables are stored only as a lower  and upper bound whereas discrete variables allow any sub-domain.
Bound variables need a domain given as a range as follows: 
 \begin{verbatim}
BOUND b {1..3}   
 \end{verbatim}

Discrete vars also need a domain given as a range as follows:   
\begin{verbatim}
DISCRETE d {1..3} 
\end{verbatim}

Sparse bound variables take a sorted list of values as follows:
\begin{verbatim}
SPARSEBOUND s {1,3,6,7} 
\end{verbatim}

We can also declare matrices of variables. The first example is a matrix with 3 variables: q[0],q[1] and q[2].
\begin{verbatim}
DISCRETE q[3] {0..5} 
\end{verbatim}

The second example is of a 2d matrix, where the variables are bm[0,0], bm[0,1], bm[1,0], bm[1,1].
\begin{verbatim}
BOOL bm[2,2] 
\end{verbatim}

The third example shows how to declare a matrix with more indices. You can have as many indices as you like!
\begin{verbatim}
BOOL bn[2,2,2,2] 
\end{verbatim}

In this next section, which is optional, you can define tuplelists. Tuplelists provide a method of defining sets of tuples which can then be used in \texttt{table} and \texttt{negativetable} constraints. Defining these in a \texttt{**TUPLELIST**} does not change the search, but can save memory by reusing the same list of tuples in multiple constraints.The input is: $\langle$name$\rangle$ $\langle$num$\_$of$\_$tuples$\rangle$ $\langle$tuple$\_$length$\rangle$ $\langle$numbers$\ldots \rangle$.
\begin{verbatim}
**TUPLELIST**
Fred 3 3
0 2 3
2 0 3
3 1 3
\end{verbatim}

The next thing to declare are the constraints which go in  this section.
\begin{verbatim}
**CONSTRAINTS**
\end{verbatim}

Constraints are defined in the same way as functions are in most programming paradigms!  A complete list of constraints can be found at the end of  the manual. The two following constraints very simply set bo=0 and b=d.
\begin{verbatim}
eq(bo, 0)
eq(b,d)
\end{verbatim}

Note that except in special cases (the \texttt{reify} and \texttt{reifyimply} constraints), Minion constraints cannot be nested. For example \texttt{eq(eq(bo,0), d)} is not valid. Such constraints must be written by manually adding extra variables.

To get a single variable from a matrix, you index it with square brackets using commas to delimitate the dimensions of the matrix. The first example following is a 1D matrix, the second in 4D. 
\begin{verbatim}
eq(q[1],0)
eq(bn[0,1,1,1], bm[1,1])
\end{verbatim}

It's easy to get a row or column from a matrix.  You use $\_$ in the indices you want to vary.  Giving a matrix without an index simply gives all the variables in that matrix. The following shows how flattening occurs...\\
$[bm] == [ bm[\_,\_] ] == [ bm[0,0], bm[0,1], bm[1,0], bm[1,1] ]$\\
$[ bm[\_,1] ] = [ bm[0,1], bm[1,1] ]$\\
$[ bn[1,\_,0,\_] = [ bn[1,0,0,0], b[1,0,0,1], b[1,1,0,0], b[1,1,0,1] ]$\\

You can string together a list of such expressions as in the following example:
\begin{verbatim}
lexleq( [bn[1,_,0,_], bo, q[0]] , [b, bm, d] )
\end{verbatim}

So the parser can recognise them you must always put [ ] around any matrix expression, so lexleq(bm, bm) is invalid, but the following is valid:
\begin{verbatim}
lexleq( [bm], [bm] )
\end{verbatim}

An example of a constraint which uses tuples
\begin{verbatim}
table([q], Fred)
\end{verbatim}

You do not have to pre-declare tuples, you can write them explicitly if you wish. The above constraint for example is equivalent to:
\begin{verbatim}
table([q],{ <0,2,3>,<2,0,3>,<3,1,3> })
\end{verbatim}

The last section is the search section. This section is optional, and allows some limited control over the way minion searches for a solution. Note that everything in this section can be given at most once.
\begin{verbatim}
**SEARCH** 
\end{verbatim}

You give the variable ordering by listing each of the variables in the order you wish them to be searched. You can either list each of the variables in a matrix individually by giving the index of each variable, or you can just state the matrix in which case it goes through each of the variables in turn. If you miss any of the variables out than these variables are not branched on. Note that this can lead to Minion reporting invalid solutions, so use with care! If you don't give an explicit variable ordering, than one is generated based on the order the variables are declared. If you give a \texttt{-varorder} on the command line, that will only consider the variable given in the \texttt{VARORDER}.
\begin{verbatim}
VARORDER [bo,b,d,q[_]] 
\end{verbatim}

You give the value order for each variable as either \texttt{a} for ascending or \texttt{d} for descending. The value orderings are given in the same order as the variable ordering. For example, to make the variable b by searched in descending order you make the second term into a \texttt{d} as the above variable ordering shows it to be the second variable to be searched. The default variable order is ascending order for all variables.
\begin{verbatim}
VALORDER [a,a,d,a]
\end{verbatim}

You can have one objective function which can be either to maximise or minimise any single variable. To minimise a constraint, you should assign it equal to a new variable.
\begin{verbatim}
MAXIMISING bo
# MINIMISING x3
\end{verbatim}

The print statement takes a 2D matrix of things to print. The following example prints both the variables bo and q, putting these in double square brackets turns them into a 2D matrix so they are acceptable input.  You can also give:  PRINT ALL (the default) which prints all variables and PRINT NONE which turns printing off completely.
\begin{verbatim}
PRINT [ [bo, q] ]
\end{verbatim}


The file must end with the **EOF** marker! Any text under that is ignored, so you can write 
whatever you like (or nothing at all...)
\begin{verbatim}
**EOF**
\end{verbatim}

The only remaining part of Minion's input language are its many constraints. These are listed in the Appendix.

\section{The Farmers Problem}
The Farmers Problem is a very simple problem which makes a very good example to be the first CP that you model. The problem is as follows:  A farmer has 7 animals on his farm: pigs and hens. They all together have 22 legs. How many pigs (4 legs) and how many hens(2 legs) does the farmer have? These files can be found in \texttt{/summer\_school/examples}. The Essence' file is named \texttt{FarmersProblem.eprime} and the Minion file is \texttt{FarmersProblem.minion}

The Essence' specification of this (which was explained in detail in the Tailor section is as follows:

\begin{verbatim}
find pigs, hens: int(0..7)

such that

pigs + hens = 7,
pigs * 4 + hens * 2 = 22
\end{verbatim}

The Minion input file for this is:
\begin{verbatim}
MINION 3

\end{verbatim}
There are two variables pigs and hens  both have domain {0..7}

\begin{verbatim}
**VARIABLES**
DISCRETE pigs {0..7}
DISCRETE hens {0..7}
\end{verbatim}

Both variables pigs and hens should be printed and the variable ordering is search pigs than hens.
\begin{verbatim}
**SEARCH**

PRINT [[pigs],[hens]]

VARORDER [pigs,hens]


**CONSTRAINTS**
\end{verbatim}

The following two constraints relate to the following $(pigs \times 4) + (hens \times 2) = 22$. There is no weighted sum constraint in Minion so you should use the weighted sum less than and equal to constraint and the weighted sum greater than and equal to constraint. You read this as  $(hens \times 2) + (pigs \times 4)) \leq 22$ and $(hens \times 2) + (pigs \times 4)  \geq 22$.
\begin{verbatim}
weightedsumgeq([2,4], [hens,pigs], 22)
weightedsumleq([2,4], [hens,pigs], 22)
\end{verbatim}

The following two constraints relate to the following $pigs + hens = 7$. There is no sum constraint in Minion so you should use the sum less than and equal to constraint and the sum greater than and equal to constraint. You read this as $hens + pigs \leq 7$ and $hens + pigs \geq 7$.
\begin{verbatim}
sumleq([hens,pigs], 7)
sumgeq([hens,pigs], 7)
**EOF**
\end{verbatim}

\section{Cryptarithmetic}
The second problem outlined is a very famous Cryptarithmetic puzzle: SEND + MORE = MONEY. These files can be found in \texttt{/summer\_school/examples} the Essence' file is \texttt{SENDMOREMONEY.eprime} and the Minion file is \texttt{SENDMOREMONEY.minion}. The Essence' specification is as follows:

\begin{verbatim}
find S,E,N,D,M,O,R,Y : int(0..9)

such that

1000*S + 100*E + 10*N + D + 
1000*M + 100*O + 10*R + E =
10000*M + 1000*O + 100*N + 10*E + Y,

alldiff([S,E,N,D,M,O,R,Y])
\end{verbatim}

The Minion model is then:

\begin{verbatim}
MINION 3
\end{verbatim}

There are 8 variables: S,E,N,D,M,O,R,Y all with domains 0 to 9.
\begin{verbatim}
**VARIABLES**
DISCRETE S {0..9}
DISCRETE E {0..9}
DISCRETE N {0..9}
DISCRETE D {0..9}
DISCRETE M {0..9}
DISCRETE O {0..9}
DISCRETE R {0..9}
DISCRETE Y {0..9}
\end{verbatim}

Search the variables in the order S, E, N, D, M, O, R, Y and print the same variable in this order.
\begin{verbatim}
**SEARCH**

PRINT [[S],[E],[N],[D],[M],[O],[R],[Y]]

VARORDER [S,E,N,D,M,O,R,Y]
\end{verbatim}

The first constraint is an all different which is across all variables this is an implicit constraint in the problem, as all the letters represent different numbers.
\begin{verbatim}
**CONSTRAINTS**

alldiff([ S, E, N, D, M, O, R, Y])
\end{verbatim}

The second constraint represents:$(1000 \times S) + (100 \times E) + (10 \times N) + D +  (1000 \times M) + (100 \times O )+ (10 \times R) + E = (10000 \times M) + (1000 \times O) + (100 \times N) + (10 \times E) + Y$.  The first thing the model does is rewrite this expression to make it equal to a number, in this case 0. So this expression becomes: $(10000 \times M) + (1000 \times O) + (100 \times N) + (10 \times E) + Y - (1000 \times S)  - (100 \times E) - (10 \times N) - D - (1000 \times M) - (100 \times O) - (10 \times R) - E = 0$. The terms are then rearranged so the same weights are together and the positive numbers are first this then becomes: $Y + (10 \times E) + (100 \times N) + (1000 \times O) + (10000 \times M) -D - E - (10 \times N) - (10 \times R) - (100 \times E) - (100 \times O)  - (1000 \times M) - (1000 \times S) = 0$. Minion does not have a weighted sum equals constraint, so this is represented as one weighted sum less than or equal to and one weighted sum greater than or equal to. The two constraints are then: $Y + (10 \times E) + (100 \times N) + (1000 \times O) + (10000 \times M) -D - E - (10 \times N) - (10 \times R) - (100 \times E) - (100 \times O)  - (1000 \times M) - (1000 \times S) \leq 0$ and $Y + (10 \times E) + (100 \times N) + (1000 \times O) + (10000 \times M) -D - E - (10 \times N) - (10 \times R) - (100 \times E) - (100 \times O)  - (1000 \times M) - (1000 \times S) \geq 0$.

\begin{verbatim}
weightedsumgeq(
	[1,10,100,1000,10000,-1,-1,-10,-10,-100,-100,-1000,-1000], 
	[Y,E,N,O,M,D,E,N,R,E,O,M,S], 0)
weightedsumleq(
	[1,10,100,1000,10000,-1,-1,-10,-10,-100,-100,-1000,-1000],
	[Y,E,N,O,M,D,E,N,R,E,O,M,S], 0)

**EOF**
\end{verbatim}

\section{The Eight Number Puzzle}
The eight number puzzle asks you to label the nodes of the graph shown in Figure~\ref{fig:8puzzle} with the values 1 to 8 such that no two connected nodes have consecutive values.  These files can be found in /summer\_school/examples the Essence' file is EightPuzzleDiagram.eprime and the Minion file is EightPuzzleDiagram.minion. The Essence' specification is as follows:

\begin{figure}[htp]
\centering
\includegraphics[scale=0.25] {EightPuzzleDiagram.pdf} 
\caption{Graph which represents The Eight Number Puzzle}
\label{fig:8puzzle}
\end{figure}

\begin{verbatim}
find circles: matrix indexed by [int(1..8)] of int(1..8)

such that

alldiff(circles),
| circles[1] - circles[2] | > 1,
| circles[1] - circles[3] | > 1,
| circles[1] - circles[4] | > 1,
| circles[2] - circles[3] | > 1,
| circles[3] - circles[4] | > 1,
| circles[2] - circles[5] | > 1,
| circles[2] - circles[6] | > 1,
| circles[3] - circles[5] | > 1,
| circles[3] - circles[6] | > 1,
| circles[3] - circles[7] | > 1,
| circles[4] - circles[6] | > 1,
| circles[4] - circles[7] | > 1,
| circles[5] - circles[6] | > 1,
| circles[6] - circles[7] | > 1,
| circles[5] - circles[8] | > 1,
| circles[6] - circles[8] | > 1,
| circles[7] - circles[8] | > 1
\end{verbatim}

The Minion model is then:

\begin{verbatim}
MINION 3
\end{verbatim}

There is a 1d matrix of size 8 with domain \{1,..,8\} to represent the 8 circles which numbers can be allocated to.  There are also 34 auxiliary variables, 2 to represent each constraint.

\begin{verbatim}
**VARIABLES**
DISCRETE circles[8] {1..8}

# auxiliary variables
DISCRETE aux0 {-7..7}
DISCRETE aux1 {0..7}
DISCRETE aux2 {-7..7}
DISCRETE aux3 {0..7}
DISCRETE aux4 {-7..7}
DISCRETE aux5 {0..7}
DISCRETE aux6 {-7..7}
DISCRETE aux7 {0..7}
DISCRETE aux8 {-7..7}
DISCRETE aux9 {0..7}
DISCRETE aux10 {-7..7}
DISCRETE aux11 {0..7}
DISCRETE aux12 {-7..7}
DISCRETE aux13 {0..7}
DISCRETE aux14 {-7..7}
DISCRETE aux15 {0..7}
DISCRETE aux16 {-7..7}
DISCRETE aux17 {0..7}
DISCRETE aux18 {-7..7}
DISCRETE aux19 {0..7}
DISCRETE aux20 {-7..7}
DISCRETE aux21 {0..7}
DISCRETE aux22 {-7..7}
DISCRETE aux23 {0..7}
DISCRETE aux24 {-7..7}
DISCRETE aux25 {0..7}
DISCRETE aux26 {-7..7}
DISCRETE aux27 {0..7}
DISCRETE aux28 {-7..7}
DISCRETE aux29 {0..7}
DISCRETE aux30 {-7..7}
DISCRETE aux31 {0..7}
DISCRETE aux32 {-7..7}
DISCRETE aux33 {0..7}
\end{verbatim}

The variable ordering branches on all the circle variables before each of the aux variables. Only the circle variables are printed.

\begin{verbatim}
**SEARCH**

PRINT [circles]

VARORDER [circles,
aux0,aux1,aux2,aux3,aux4,aux5,aux6,aux7,
aux8,aux9,aux10,aux11,aux12,aux13,aux14,aux15,
aux16,aux17,aux18,aux19,aux20,aux21,aux22,aux23,
aux24,aux25,aux26,aux27,aux28,aux29,aux30,aux31,
aux32,aux33]
\end{verbatim}

The all different constraint on the circle variables are explicit in the  problem, this is the first constraint in the collection. The other constraints are all of the type $|circles[a] - circles[b]| > 1$. The first of these such constraints is $|circles[1] - circles[2]| > 1$ this type of constraint is represented by a series of 4 constraints in MInion.   The constraints are reversed in the Minion specification so that the last 4 constraints represent this first expression. The constraints are indexed from 1 in Essence' and 1 in Minion, so the above constraint becomes $|circles[0] - circles[1]| > 1$. Then $|circles[0] - circles[1]| > 1$ is decomposed to $circles[1] - circles[2] = aux0$ and $|aux0| = aux1$ and $1 \leq aux1-1$.  As Minion has no weighted sum equals to constraint a weighted sum greater than or equals to constraint and a weighted sum less than or equals to, so $circles[1] - circles[2] = aux0$ is $circles[1] - circles[2] \leq aux0$ and $circles[1] - circles[2] \geq aux0$. The other constraints all form the same pattern.

\section{A $K_4 \times P_2$ Graceful Graph}
This problem is stated as follows. A labelling $f$ of the nodes of a graph with $q$ edges is graceful if $f$ assigns each node a unique label from $0,1,..., q$ and when each edge $xy$ is labelled with $|f(x) - f(y)|$, the edge labels are all different. (Hence, the edge labels are a permutation of $1, 2, ..., q$.) Does the $K_4 \times P_2$ graph shown in Figure~\ref{fig:k4xp2} have a graceful library.  These files can be found in \texttt{/summer\_school/examples}, the Essence' file is called \texttt{K4P2GracefulGraph.eprime} and the Minion file is \texttt{K4P2GracefulGraph.minion}. The Essence' specification is as follows:

\begin{figure}[htp]
\centering
\includegraphics[scale=0.25] {k4xp2.pdf}

\begin{verbatim}

\end{verbatim}

The Minion model is then:

\begin{verbatim}
MINION 3
\end{verbatim}

There are two 1d arrays of variables one representing all the node variables and one representing all the edge variables. The 8 node variables have domain 0 to 16 and the edge variables have domain 1 to 16. There are also 16 auxiliary variables introduced called aux0 to aux15 there is one of these for each constraint and there is one constraint to represent each edge. 

\begin{verbatim}
**VARIABLES**
DISCRETE nodes[8] {0..16}
DISCRETE edges[16] {1..16}

# auxiliary variables
DISCRETE aux0 {-16..16}
DISCRETE aux1 {-16..16}

DISCRETE aux13 {-16..16}
DISCRETE aux14 {-16..16}
DISCRETE aux15 {-16..16}
\end{verbatim}

The variable order is to branch on the nodes then on the edges then the auxiliary variables. Only the node and the edge variables are printed. 

\begin{verbatim}
**SEARCH**

VARORDER [nodes,edges,
aux0,aux1,aux2,aux3,aux4,aux5,aux6,aux7,
aux8,aux9,aux10,aux11,aux12,aux13,aux14,aux15]
\end{verbatim}

Implicit in the problem is an all different constraint on both the node and edge variables. The other constraints are all of the form |nodes[a] - nodes[b]| = edges[a], the first of these constraints from the Essence' specification is $|nodes[1] - nodes[2]| = edges[1]$  this corresponds to the last three constraints in the minion file as the order of constraints are reversed. Minion starts indexing matrices from 0, whereas Essence' started numbering from 1 so the above constraint becomes $|nodes[0] - nodes[1]| = edges[0]$.  This is broken into $nodes[0] - nodes[1] = aux0$ and $|edges[0]| = aux0$. As minion has no weighted sum equals this is broken into a weighted sum less than or equals to and weighted sum greater than or equals to. So this full constraint is represented as $nodes[0] - nodes[1]  \leq aux0$ and $nodes[0] - nodes[1]  \geq aux0$ and $|edges[0]| = aux0$.

\section{The Zebra Puzzle} 

The Zebra Puzzle is a very famous logic puzzle. There are many different versions, but the version we will answer is as follows:
\begin{enumerate}
\item There are five houses.
\item The Englishman lives in the red house.
\item The Spaniard owns the dog.
\item Coffee is drunk in the green house.
\item The Ukrainian drinks tea.
\item The green house is immediately to the right of the ivory house.
\item The Old Gold smoker owns snails.
\item Kools are smoked in the yellow house.
\item Milk is drunk in the middle house.
\item The Norwegian lives in the first house.
\item The man who smokes Chesterfields lives in the house next to the man with the fox.
\item Kools are smoked in the house next to the house where the horse is kept.
\item The Lucky Strike smoker drinks orange juice.
\item The Japanese smokes Parliaments.
\item The Norwegian lives next to the blue house.
\end{enumerate}
Now, who drinks water? Who owns the zebra? In the interest of clarity, it must be added that each of the five houses is painted a different color, and their inhabitants are of different national extractions, own different pets, drink different beverages and smoke different brands of American cigarettes.  These files can be found in /summer\_school/examples the Essence' file is zebra.eprime and the Minion file is zebra.minion. The Essence' specification is as follows:

\begin{verbatim}
language ESSENCE' 1.b.a

$red = colour[1]
$green = colour[2]
$ivory = colour[3]
$yellow = colour[4]
$blue = colour[5]
$Englishman = nationality[1]
$Spaniard = nationality[2]
$Ukranian = nationality[3]
$Norwegian = nationality[4]
$Japanese = nationality[5]
$coffee = drink[1]
$tea = drink[2]
$milk = drink[3]
$orange juice = drink[4]
$Old Gold = smoke[1]
$Kools = smoke[2]
$Chesterfields = smoke[3]
$Lucky Strike = smoke[4]
$Parliaments = smoke[5]
$dog = pets[1]
$snails = pets[2]
$fox = pets[3]
$horse = pets[4]


find colour: matrix indexed by [int(1..5)] of int(1..5),
       nationality: matrix indexed by [int(1..5)] of int(1..5),
       drink: matrix indexed by [int(1..5)] of int(1..5),
       smoke: matrix indexed by [int(1..5)] of int(1..5),
       pets: matrix indexed by [int(1..5)] of int(1..5)

such that

$constraints needed as this is a logical problem where 
$the value allocated to each position of the matrix 
$represents positon of house
alldiff(colour),
alldiff(nationality),
alldiff(drink),
alldiff(smoke),
alldiff(pets),

$There are five houses.
$No constraint covered by domain specification

$The Englishman lives in the red house
nationality[1] = colour[1],

$The Spaniard owns the dog.
nationality[2] = pets[1],

$Coffee is drunk in the green house.
drink[1] = colour[2],

$The Ukranian drinks tea.
nationality[3] = drink[2],

$The green house is immediately to the 
$right of the ivory house.
colour[2] + 1 = colour[3],

$The Old Gold smoker owns snails.
smoke[1] = pets[2],

$Kools are smoked in the yellow house.
smoke[2] = colour[4],

$Milk is drunk in the middle house.
drink[3] = 3,

$The Norwegian lives in the first house
nationality[4] = 1,

$The man who smokes Chesterfields lives in 
$the house next to the man with the fox.
|smoke[3] - pets[3]| = 1,

$Kools are smoked in the house next 
$ to the house where the horse is kept.
|smoke[2] - pets[4]| = 1,

$The Lucky Strike smoker drinks orange juice.
smoke[4] = drink[4],

$The Japanese smokes Parliaments.
nationality[5] = smoke[5],

$The Norwegian lives next to the blue house.
|nationality[4] - colour[5]| = 1

\end{verbatim}

The Minion model is then: 

\begin{verbatim}
MINION 3
\end{verbatim}

There are matrices named colour, nationality, drink, smoke and pets to represent each of the objects discussed in the puzzle. They have domain $\{1,\ldots ,5\}$  which represents where in the row of five houses this object is held. There are also three auxiliary variables introduced which are necessary for the most difficult constraints, these all have domains $\{-4,\ldots ,4\}$.

\begin{verbatim}
**VARIABLES**
DISCRETE colour[5] {1..5}
DISCRETE nationality[5] {1..5}
DISCRETE drink[5] {1..5}
DISCRETE smoke[5] {1..5}
DISCRETE pets[5] {1..5}

# auxiliary variables
DISCRETE aux0 {-4..4}
DISCRETE aux1 {-4..4}
DISCRETE aux2 {-4..4}
\end{verbatim}

The variable order branches on each of the matrices in turn then on the auxiliary variables. Only the matrices of variables are printed.

\begin{verbatim}
**SEARCH**

PRINT [colour,nationality,drink,smoke,pets]

VARORDER [colour,nationality,drink,smoke,pets,aux0,aux1,aux2]
\end{verbatim}

We will go through each constraint in turn. As usual the constraints in Minion are in the reverse order of the Essence' specification and the minion matrices are indexed from 0 whereas 
\begin{verbatim}
**CONSTRAINTS**
\end{verbatim}

$|nationality[4] - colour[5]| = 1$ becomes by counting indices from zero: $|nationality[3] - colour[4]| = 1$. This is then decomposed as $nationality[3] - colour[4] \geq aux2$, $nationality[3] - colour[4] \leq aux2$ and $|aux2|=1$.
\begin{verbatim}
weightedsumgeq([1,-1], [nationality[3],colour[4]], aux2)
weightedsumleq([1,-1], [nationality[3],colour[4]], aux2)
abs(1,aux2)
\end{verbatim}

$nationality[5] = smoke[5]$ becomes by counting indices from zero: $nationality[4] = smoke[4]$.
\begin{verbatim}
eq(nationality[4], smoke[4])
\end{verbatim}

$drink[4] = smoke[4]$ becomes by counting indices from zero: $drink[3] = smoke[3]$.
\begin{verbatim}
eq(drink[3], smoke[3])
\end{verbatim} 

$|smoke[2] - pets[4]| = 1$ becomes by counting indices from zero: $|smoke[1] - pets[3]| = 1$. This is then decomposed as $smoke[1] - pets[3] \leq aux1$, $smoke[1] - pets[3] \geq aux1$ and $|aux1|=1$.

abs(1,aux1)
\end{verbatim}

$|smoke[3] - pets[3]| = 1$ becomes by counting indices from zero: $|smoke[2] - pets[2]| = 1$. This is then decomposed as $smoke[2] - pets[2] \leq aux0$, $smoke[2] - pets[2] \geq aux0$ and $|aux0|=1$.
\begin{verbatim}
weightedsumgeq([1,-1], [smoke[2],pets[2]], aux0)
weightedsumleq([1,-1], [smoke[2],pets[2]], aux0)

\end{verbatim}

$nationality[4] = 1$ becomes by counting indices from zero: $nationality[3] = 1$.
\begin{verbatim}
eq(1, nationality[3])
\end{verbatim}

$drink[3] = 3$ becomes by counting indices from zero: $drink[2] = 3$.
\begin{verbatim}
eq(3, drink[2])
\end{verbatim}

$smoke[2] = colour[4]$ becomes by counting indices from zero: $smoke[1] = colour[3]$
\begin{verbatim}
eq(colour[3], smoke[1])
\end{verbatim}

$smoke[1] = pets[2]$ becomes by counting indices from zero: $smoke[0] = pets[1]$
\begin{verbatim}
eq(pets[1], smoke[0])
\end{verbatim}

$colour[2] + 1 = colour[3]$ becomes by counting indices from zero: $colour[1] + 1 = colour[2]$. This is decomposed as $colour[1] + 1 \leq colour[2]$ and $colour[1] + 1 \geq colour[2]$. 
\begin{verbatim}
sumleq([1,colour[1]], colour[2])
sumgeq([1,colour[1]], colour[2])
\end{verbatim}

$nationality[3] = drink[2]$ becomes by counting indices from zero: $nationality[2] = drink[1]$
\begin{verbatim}
eq(drink[1], nationality[2])
\end{verbatim}

$drink[1] = colour[2]$ becomes by counting indices from zero: $drink[0] = colour[1]$
\begin{verbatim}
eq(colour[1], drink[0])
\end{verbatim}

$nationality[2] = pets[1]$ becomes by counting indices from zero: $nationality[1] = pets[0]$
\begin{verbatim}

\end{verbatim}

$nationality[1] = colour[1]$ becomes by counting indices from zero: $nationality[0] = colour[0]$
\begin{verbatim}
eq(colour[0], nationality[0])
\end{verbatim}

There is an implicit all different in the problem which is placed over all the matrices of variables.
\begin{verbatim}
alldiff([pets])
alldiff([smoke])
alldiff([drink])
alldiff([nationality])
alldiff([colour])

\end{verbatim}


\section{N-Queens}
N-Queens is perhaps the most famous problem in CP. It is often used to demonstrate systems. It is stated as  the problem of putting $n$ chess queens on an $n \times n$ chessboard such that none of them is able to capture any other using the standard chess queen's moves. The model we will discuss here is the column model, where there is one variable of domain 1, .. n for each row,  which is the easiest model to describe. We will look at the version where $n=4$ as this has a reasonably small number of constraints to  These files can be found in /summer\_school/examples the Essence' file is NQueensColumn.eprime and the Minion file is NQueensColumn.minion. The Essence' specification is as follows:

\begin{verbatim}
given n: int
find queens: matrix indexed by [int(1..n)] of int(1..n)

such that

forall i : int(1..n). forall j : int(i+1..n).
 |queens[i] - queens[j]| != |i - j|,
 alldiff(queens),

letting n be 4
\end{verbatim}

The Minion model is then: 
\begin{verbatim}
MINION 3
\end{verbatim}

There are 4 variables, each of which represents a column of the chess board. This instance is of a $4 \times 4$ chessboard so there are 4 variables stored in a matrix called queens with domain $\{1,\ldots ,4\}$.  There are two auxiliary variables for each of the 6 diagonal constraints, one with domain $\{-3, \ldots ,3\}$ and one with domain $\{0, \ldots ,3\}$.

\begin{verbatim}
**VARIABLES**
DISCRETE queens[4] {1..4}

# auxiliary variables
DISCRETE aux0 {-3..3}
DISCRETE aux1 {0..3}
DISCRETE aux2 {-3..3}
DISCRETE aux3 {0..3}
DISCRETE aux4 {-3..3}
DISCRETE aux5 {0..3}
DISCRETE aux6 {-3..3}
DISCRETE aux7 {0..3}
DISCRETE aux8 {-3..3}
DISCRETE aux9 {0..3}
DISCRETE aux10 {-3..3}
DISCRETE aux11 {0..3}
\end{verbatim}

The variable order branches on each of the matrice variables in turn then on the auxiliary variables. Only the matrice of variables is printed.
\begin{verbatim}
**SEARCH**

PRINT [queens]

VARORDER [queens,
aux0,aux1,aux2,aux3,aux4,aux5,aux6,aux7,
aux8,aux9,aux10,aux11]
\end{verbatim}

There is an all different constraint on the queens variables. This ensures that two queens cannot be put in the same row. The other constraints stop two queens being placed on a diagonal. These diagonal constraints are all of the form $|queens[i] - queens[j]| \ne |i - j|$.  This is decomposed into the following: $queens[i] - queens[j] = auxa$, $|auxa| = auxb$ and $auxb \ne constant$.  As minion has no weighted sum equals the constraint is broken into a weighted sum less than or equals to and weighted sum greater than or equals to. So this full constraint $queens[i] - queens[j] = auxa$  is represented as $queens[i] - queens[j] \leq auxa$ and $queens[i] - queens[j] \geq auxa$.

\begin{verbatim}
**CONSTRAINTS**

weightedsumgeq([1,-1], [queens[2],queens[3]], aux0)
weightedsumleq([1,-1], [queens[2],queens[3]], aux0)
abs(aux1,aux0)
weightedsumgeq([1,-1], [queens[1],queens[3]], aux2)
weightedsumleq([1,-1], [queens[1],queens[3]], aux2)
abs(aux3,aux2)
weightedsumgeq([1,-1], [queens[1],queens[2]], aux4)
weightedsumleq([1,-1], [queens[1],queens[2]], aux4)
abs(aux5,aux4)
diseq(2, aux3)
weightedsumgeq([1,-1], [queens[0],queens[3]], aux6)
weightedsumleq([1,-1], [queens[0],queens[3]], aux6)
abs(aux7,aux6)
weightedsumgeq([1,-1], [queens[0],queens[2]], aux8)
weightedsumleq([1,-1], [queens[0],queens[2]], aux8)
abs(aux9,aux8)
weightedsumgeq([1,-1], [queens[0],queens[1]], aux10)
weightedsumleq([1,-1], [queens[0],queens[1]], aux10)
abs(aux11,aux10)
diseq(3, aux7)
diseq(2, aux9)
diseq(1, aux1)
diseq(1, aux5)
diseq(1, aux11)
alldiff([queens])

\appendix
\chapter{All the Minion programming constructs}
You are viewing documentation for minion. The same 
documentation is available from a minion executable by 
typing \texttt{minion help} at the command line.
We intend that the command line help system be the 
main source of documentation for the system.

Each of the entries below concerns a different aspect
of the system, and the entries are arranged hierarchically.
For example to view information about the set of available
constraints as a whole view ``constraints'' and to view
specific information about the alldiff constraint view 
``constraints alldiff''.

A good place to start would be viewing the 
``input example'' entry which exhibits a complete
example of a minion input file.

Usage: \texttt{minion [switches] [minion input file]}
